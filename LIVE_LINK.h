/*
	Live link: OpenCAGE edits the scripting of a level while the game runs it.

	The game keeps the level's COMMANDS.PAK in memory exactly as it is on disk (the entity manager's loader reads the
	whole file into one block). A composite template is the PAK's composite record, whose arrays are each stored as an
	offset, in 4-byte words from the start of that block, and a count. OpenCAGE sends a composite as a standalone PAK
	image plus the words in it that are offsets; the image is rebased onto the block (32-bit wrap-around makes any
	address reachable), its parameters are turned into the game's variable objects the way that loader does, and the
	template record is pointed at the new arrays. The running instances of that composite are then brought in
	line: entities that went are shut down and removed, new ones are constructed and initialised, entities whose
	parameters changed are live edited in place (the game's own live edit of an entity's state - what CA's own live link
	used, which reinitialises the entity and lets it react to the edit itself), and every entity's parameter/link cache
	is flushed.

	Method calls (e.g. "start" on a DebugTextStacking) are queued as triggers, the way the game's own code does.

	Everything here runs on the thread that processes entities (from the hook on the entity manager's per-frame
	processing, below).
