/*
	The live link connection: a WebSocket server on 127.0.0.1 (port 8765 by default) that OpenCAGE connects to.

	Binary messages carry requests, little-endian:
	  u32 magic 'OCLL', u16 version (1), u16 command, u32 request id, then the command's payload.
	Every request is answered with the same header (command | 0x8000), then u8 ok, u32 length + UTF-8 message, then any
	reply payload. Text messages are the older JSON packets ({"version":1,"load_level":"..."}), which get no reply.
	root is the root composite of the level OpenCAGE has open: a request for another level is refused on the entity
	thread. Connections that carry an Origin header (web pages) are refused, and one client is served at a time (another
	is turned away at once).

	Requests on entities are carried out on the entity thread (from the hook on the entity manager's per-frame
	processing), screenshots and level loads on the render thread (the hook where D3D11 shows each finished frame), so the
	socket thread never touches the game. CAMERA and CAMERA_GET are the exceptions: the socket thread only checks which
	level is running (plain reads of the entity manager) and stores the pose, or reads the camera hook's last snapshot of
	the game camera, answering at once - they are never queued behind edits held while a level starts - and the camera
	hook applies the pose (see LIVE_CAMERA.cpp). ANIMATION and ANIMATION_GET are answered at once the same way: the
	request is stored, or the entity thread's last snapshot of what it did with it read, and the entity thread carries
	it out every frame (see LIVE_ANIMATION.h). So are TRACE and TRACE_GET: what to trace is stored, or what the trace hooks
	gathered handed over, and the hooks gather it on whichever threads run the level's scripts (see LIVE_TRACE.h).
